        <p>EEBO allows users to view and search digital facsimiles of virtually every work printed in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and British North America and other works printed in English from 1473-1700. Containing 125,000 titles, this collection includes the first book printed in English by William Caxton, early quarto editions of Shakespeare's plays with the renowned First Folio edition of 1623 and the earliest editions of classics such as Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Malory's Morte d'Arthur.</p>
        <p>The timing was nigh for a new Beringia map, said Jeffrey Bond, who studies the geology of ice age sediments at the Yukon Geological Survey in Canada. The 2008 map at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre was out of date, and he wanted visitors, who come to learn about Beringia's ice age humans and animals, to get a better sense of what the region used to look like.

        <p>This vast, open region allowed megafauna and early humans to live off the land, Brigham-Grette said. However, it's still a mystery exactly when humans began crossing the land bridge. Genetic studies show that the first humans to cross became genetically isolated from people in East Asia between about 25,000 to 20,000 years ago. And archaeological evidence shows that people reached the Yukon at least 14,000 years ago, Bond said. But it's still unclear how long it took the first Americans to cross the bridge and what route they took.</p>
