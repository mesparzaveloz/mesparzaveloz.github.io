        The wolf (Canis lupus),<sup>[a]</sup> also known as the grey/gray wolf or timber wolf,[4][5] is a canine native to the
        wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with
        males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb) and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb).[6] It is distinguished from other Canis
        species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.[7] Its winter fur is
        long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, and brown to black
        also occur.[5] Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed., 2005), a standard reference work in zoology, recognises 38
        subspecies of C. lupus.[8] <br>

        The gray wolf is the second most specialized member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as
        demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature,[9] and its
        highly advanced expressive behavior.[10][11] It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species,
        such as the coyote,[12] and golden jackal,[13][14] to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis
        to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds,[15] and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene,
        colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean.[15] It is a social
        animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult
        offspring.[16] The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and
        tigers[9][17][18][19] posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats
        smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.[5] A seven-year-old wolf is considered to be relatively old,
        and the maximum lifespan is about 16 years.[20] <br>

        The global gray wolf population is estimated to be 300,000.[21] The gray wolf is one of the world's best-known
        and most-researched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species.[22] It
        has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities
        because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer
        societies.[23] Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded
        attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and
        killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have
        developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.[24] </p>

    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p class="info-text">
        The evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of at least 300 thousand years. The gray wolf
        Canis lupus is a highly adaptable species that is able to exist in a range of environments and which possesses a
        wide distribution across the Holarctic. Studies of modern gray wolves have identified distinct sub-populations
        that live in close proximity to each other.[27][28] This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to
        differences in habitat – precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization – which affect
        cranio-dental plasticity.<sup>[29][30][31][32]</sup> <br>

        The archaeological and paleontological records show gray wolf continuous presence for at least the last 300,000
        years.[33] This continuous presence contrasts with genomic analyses, which suggest that all modern wolves and
        dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population[34][35][36] that existed as recently as 20,000 years
        ago.[34] These analyses indicate a population bottleneck, followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral
        population at a time during, or just after, the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the geographic origin of this
        radiation is not known. <br>

        In 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of genus Canis, along with the dhole (Cuon alpinus)
        and the African hunting dog (Lycaon pictus). There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves,
        golden jackals, and gray wolves. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula showed high admixture
        with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and
        Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There was evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle
        Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes
        that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the
        Eurasian and North American gray wolves. The study indicates that the common ancestor of the coyote and gray
        wolf has genetically admixed with a ghost population of an extinct unidentified canid. The canid is genetically
        close to the dhole and has evolved after the divergence of the African hunting dog from the other canid species.
        The basal position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the
        mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid.[37]<br>
